Hello everyone!

This is the source code to Server Log. I made this open source to show everyone how simple it was to make the plugin and for others to use this as a learning tool. It is not meant for compiling and using for free, even though I know many people will use it for that. I would much appreciate the purchase of the full version as I does help me get motivated to produce more updates and such.

Lova you all,
Bryan C.
